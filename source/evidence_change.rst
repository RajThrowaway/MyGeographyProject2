Evidence of Change
==================

Currently Antarctica has been experiencing a temperature increase rate in the Antarctic Peninsula which is five times that of the mean global warming rate, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

As a result, the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula has become one of the most rapidly warming places on Earth over a period of the past fifty years. Moreover the Southern Ocean, the ocean that surrounds Antarctica, is undergoing the same rate of warming. Since 1995, upper ocean temperatures, west of the Antarctic Peninsula, have undergone an increase of over 1°C. Moreover, according to the IPCC, it has been established since then that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has been warming much more quickly compared to other global oceans.

Moving on, scientists have confirmed that Antarctica’s winds play a crucial role when it comes to dictating the temperature, and overall climate as a whole, in Antarctica. In the 1920s, winds were consistently cold, only altering between being either cold and extremely cold. On the other hand, since then the case has been that the winds are either warm or cold, therefore the baseline has been elevated. This is the cause of the Earth gradually warming.
