Ownership/Control
=================

Antarctica is controlled by seven sovereign states, which each have a claim to a part of the continent. These claims are made by: Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway and the UK, with Australia’s being the biggest. Moreover three of these claims overlap each other, these being the UK’s, Argentina’s, and Chile’s claims. About a tenth of the continent remains unclaimed, this area, in West Antarctica, is known as ‘Marie Byrd Land’ which makes up 1.6m million square kilometres.

Currently, there is the Antarctic Treaty in place over Antarctica. This establishes the purposes for which Antarctica is to be used for, and states that it will be used solely as a scientific preserve, and scientific investigation should be able to be conducted freely. It also bans any sort of military activity on the continent. The treaty was signed in Washington on the 1st December 1959 by the twelve countries who had been active in Antarctica in the International Geophysical Year of 1957-1958. These were: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union/USSR. The Antarctic Treaty is accompanied by several other agreements, and these collectively make up The Antarctic Treaty System.
