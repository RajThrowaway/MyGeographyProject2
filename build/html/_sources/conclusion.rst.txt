Conclusion
==========

The governments of the world should make a significant effort, to drastically hinder what effect climate change is having on Antarctica, as rather than solely affecting Antarctica, it will leave adverse impacts on countries globally.

Firstly, studying climate change in Antarctica, as well as other aspects of Antarctica, provides valuable data, which can allow scientists to predict future climate events more effectively and accurately. This can enable them to provide information which has the potential to benefit the Earth significantly.
