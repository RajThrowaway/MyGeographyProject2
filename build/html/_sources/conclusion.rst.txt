Conclusion
==========

The governments of the world should make a significant effort, to drastically hinder what effect climate change is having on Antarctica, as rather than solely affecting Antarctica, it will leave adverse impacts on countries globally.

Firstly, studying climate change in Antarctica, as well as other aspects of Antarctica, provides valuable data, which can allow scientists to predict future climate events more effectively and accurately. This can enable them to provide information which has the potential to benefit the Earth significantly.

Lastly, 80% of all of the worldâ€™s freshwater reserves are situated within Antarctica. Therefore, if they were to completely melt, global sea levels would rise by approximately 60 metres, thereby posing a major and significant threat to the global population. Rising sea levels would completely submerge low-lying islands and archipelagos, such as the Maldives, and also lead to severe coastal flooding in several countries around the globe. Consequently, several hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of people would be forced to migrate to other countries, known as mass migration. These countries would be rapidly overwhelmed socially and economically due to the mass influx of new people, potentially causing widespread poverty in the process because of overcrowding. This surge in the population may also incur an increase in the rate of climate change as congestion is one of the leading causes of increased carbon emissions, which would quickly become more frequent as there is an elevated number of vehicles from more people, which will lead to busier, and therefore more congested, roads.
 
In conclusion, Antarctica should be one of the foremost targets of conservation, preservation, and protection, from the impacts of climate change, as otherwise it is certain the Earth will experience severe, and adverse effects globally, which it will most likely not be able to cope with, as the climate situation in Antarctica escalates.
